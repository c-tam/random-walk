# random-walk

This is a python program which generates figures of random walks and diffusion limited aggregates, and other figures including statistics, performance and fractal dimension. This was written for a module scientific computing for my undergraduate physics degree.  It uses NumPy and SciPy for calculations, matplotlib for plotting and numba to accelerate the code. Tested working in Anaconda 4.7.12. A plot a a DLA generated by the script can be seen in Figure 1.
